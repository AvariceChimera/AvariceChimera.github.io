        This was my first time working with a team and in complete honesty I would gladly do it again. My team was very<br>
        understanding with me and gave me a more than fair amount of help in terms of code. (mostly just checking and making<br>
        sure it was right which I typically need someone to do out of anxiety) I did a lot of documentation and art work.<br>
        The player, The enemies, Main menu, Even the backdrop for the playscreen and the upgrade window. All done by me.<br>
        This was what i felt confident doingas recent events in my life left me... "unfit" to really push myself.<br>
        but we met deadline and made a pretty solid if a little basic shooter game not much plot or really detail.<br>
        Just shoot the robots and survive the waves, between waves you could upgrade your shot speed, damage, and even the spread for a triple shot.<br>
        I primarily worked on the level code which was easy for the most part especially with the support of my team who could more easliy<br>
        identify errors or potential bugs that i typically miss as i get a bit tunnel-visioned trying to reach a point i can<br>
        test and identify what needs to be tweaked or reworked.
