        this section is going to be a bit boring but it can't hurt to list my knowledge. So I made a list of verious languages<br>
        and engines/frameworks and how I'd rate my ability with them (or just how I liked using them) from 1 to 10<br>
        standard rules 1 is worst 10 is best yada yada let's get started!<br>
        <br>
        C++: 5/10. started here and while I understand it bug fixing in it makes me want to pull my hair out so I can/will<br>
        use it again gladly. I just think it'd be best to work in tandem with someone else on any projects using it<br>
        mostly to save my sanity but otherwise I'm confident in my ability to tinker with C++ <br>
        <br>
        SDL/OpenGL: 6/10. made an engine with them and built my first major project (and galaga but that's not something important)<br>
        they were very useful, if a little tedious to set up, and I can comfortably work with either provided I can read the code.<br>
        An issue I did have was the lack of direction a lot of the error messages gave but that's to be expected I guess, see above<br>
        for my experience with bugfixing or look at "Jewel Thief" to learn more.<br>
        <br>
        C#: 4/10. had minor issues with C# but I feel like it was largly due to lacking a visual to see what I was doing<br>
        as I was doing it. C++ had the same issue but was mitigated by several factors hence my having more confidence<br>
        with it. I can see myself using it more but not without some kind of support, primarily being able to see how my<br>
        changes effect things as I'm making them.<br>
        <br>
        Lua: 8/10. Simple language with lots of bells and whistles to tinker with I had a field day with it and will<br>
        gladly work with it again. However it being so simple comes with the downside of it breaking in ways you can't<br>
        see coming unlike C# or C++. However with that I can't say it enough, languages need to alert you of typos.<br>
        <br>
        Love2D: 7/10. a good compliment to lua and frankly needs to be more popular it has plenty of built in function<br>
        and makes a great tool to learn with. But I wouldn't discount it because of that. if anything that's why it should be<br>
        more widely used simply because if an indie dev can make good games with it iimagine if a team with real skill got a hold of it<br>
        and wanted to make something big. overall I enjoyed my time with it and feel very confident using it<br>
        <br>
        HTML/CSS/Javascript: 3/10. ironic I know but I don't think I can code a game with HTML this portfolio? yes clearly I can do that<br>
        a whole game? that's gonna take a while as most of my knowledge with HTML is found in making this CSS is good as a<br>
        supplement but it's also not something I see myself using much or at least well. JavaScript falls much the same<br>
        as CSS, good when used in supplementarry ways. But not likely something I'd attempt a full build of a game in.
