    <p>This was my first big solo project that wasn't a tutorial/making galaga I used SDL/OpenGL to build it from the ground up.<br>
    Sadly this project didn't make it to a playable state (time constraints) I'm still proud of it nonetheless.<br>
    When designing things i kinda cheated by making the base floor tile a checker patern it gave me a clear count of pixels.<br>
    As for the stuf in the tiles i had to force myself to accept imperfections because i kept getting caught on making everything centered.<br>
    After that was picking the types of gems, figuring out how to make them look, and how to score each one on it's own.<br>
    It was going to be a combitation puzzle/speed game. You would move about a meuseum exhibit trying to steal jewels and<br>
    make an escape via a drainage hatch (the grey circles with a big "E" on them). You could grab one or all five but<br>
    you couldn't leave empty-handed more jewels = more points and all that jazz. Development wasn't that bad, BUGFIXING HOWEVER<br>
    now that was rough honestly it was what caused me to miss the deadline. I was trying to fix a bug with movement and<br>
    the level spawning properly randomized (funnily enough that was the easiest part) and I was so focused on the bug hunt I<br>
    forgot the rest of the game. And by the time I wanted to get back to it we had to work on the next project so I<br>
    didn't have the time or ability to finish it. However I did make the assests myself. (though I did have them touched<br>
    up by my S.O. when I was feeling burnt out) My art isn't top notch but I like to think I have a good eye for it.

    <p>
    I really learned a lot through this project and I feel it was the first big step I took towards finding my niche.<br>
    I could easily finish it on my own time but I personally won't. As if I were to pick this up again I want to put it in<br>
    a proper engine like unity or unreal for sake of the expanded resources that are at my disposal in that case.<br>
    I don't plan on looking back largely in part to what I've learned I want to start over and try new ideas with this project.
