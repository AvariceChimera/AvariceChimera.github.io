        Back in my element taking a lead on level design (though i did also make a shop system this project) i also made the scene for the menu.<br>
        i also helped with code providing ideas for fixes and cleaning up blue prints where needed. <br>
        Development was actually pretty smooth, we played to our strengths and i feel like that really helped us along.<br>
        looking at our list of proposed improvements we can easily make the game better and possibly bigger by adding alternate levels or characters.<br> 
        even though we were pacing ourselves (by my estimation at least) we made short work of most tasks even my hastily put together dummy shop came out pretty well.<br> 
        i feel like this is what it really SHOULD be like when building a game, not necesarrily a group of friends but a team that understands each other's strengths and weaknesses,<br> 
        that way every step is forwards instead of staggering every time you wanna add something new because everyone is trying to do everything all at once.<br>
        we did have one instance of a set back when we were starting to merge files into main but it was thankfully a one time occurance, aside from that<br>
        the biggest bug we ran into was a simple fix for enemies not behaving how they should but that was an easy fix by switching the process from C++ to Blueprint.<br>

    <p>I am very proud of what we accomplished. i hope we continue to work on it going forward.</p>
