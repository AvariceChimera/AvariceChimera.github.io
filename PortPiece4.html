        My third time working in unreal5. A solo effort to make a simple golf game, got so close to i had everything but the<br>
        movement of the ball. Physics are hard... who knew, i used tile maps to make the levels and worked towards setting up a score card like on a golf course.<br>
        Development was rough given my limited knowledge but some searches online helped bridge gaps, though i'm not sure i can<br>
        say i'm proud about how much i got stuck on the ball movement. I had most other things in place but i focused on the ball<br> 
        and lost the forest for the trees so to speak. i am proud of what i DID get done but in all honesty this is a weak entry for me.<br> 
        At the end of it though i guess it should be expected new engine and all as i work more in Unreal5 i'm sure i'll be more competent.<br> 
        the most helpful source of information was the developer forums though i had difficulty understanding them sometimes, reddit made up for those moments.<br>
        an odd bug i found in the 12th hour was the project ignoring my settings. As i had set things up to make OnClick events go off of<br>
        a single click and not a double click. But that was caught much too late and the deadline was literally minutes away so it is simply a bug that was missed<br>

    <p>I enjoyed working on this, it helped me learn a lot. but seriously why is it so hard to find things...</p>
