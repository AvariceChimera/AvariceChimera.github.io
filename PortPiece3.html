        <li><p>i handled the shooting code as well as most design and QA aspects testing was fast given how small a game it was</p></li>
        <li><p>we were largely finished ahead of schedule but debugging got cut a little short thankfully we fixed everything before the final deadline</p></li>

        Third major project and second team project. again i took up most of the testing and tweaking as well as<br>
        documentation and art assets sadly i was still trying to get back in the saddle after external life events.<br>
        But no one is perfect after all, when making this we used "Robotron 2048" as a basis and made our own plot,<br>
        and assets graphically i used paint tool sai to make the player, enemies, and background.<br> 
        the hardest part was the background because it's hard to draw a motherboard with howmany different components are on one.<br> 
        Ultimately it was simple but a game that does a few things good is better than a game that does a lot of things badly if you ask me.<br> 
        In terms of coding the hardest part was getting the octodirectional aiming to work (mostly due to my keyboard ghosting my keys durring testing)<br>
        but eventually we got there then it was just a matter of getting the math to work properly which wasn't all that interesting.<br>
        But hey, it happens, plus a few issues with updating my branches but that was just github desktop being weird another<br>
        uninteresting problem that got fixed.

    <p>no AI tool this time but i feel like i did good for an indie game maybe with a bit more practice my art will look less... doodled</p>
